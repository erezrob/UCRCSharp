UCR Suite in C#

This is a C# port of the UCR Suite ported by Erez Robinson.

UCR Suite - Software that enables ultrafast subsequence search under both Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) and Euclidean Distance (ED).

The UCR Suite was developed by :

UC Riverside: Thanawin Rakthanmanon, Bilson Campana, Abdullah Mueen, Qiang Zhu, Jesin Zakaria, Eamonn Keogh
University of SÃ£o Paulo:  Gustavo Batista
Brigham and Women's Hospital:  Brandon Westover

It is quite faster than the original C++ code when built in "Release" configuration.
